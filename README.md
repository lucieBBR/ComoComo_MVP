# Full Stack "Como Como" App

Como Como is a full stack app that generates recipes based on the userâ€™s input (ingredients) by calling Spoonacular API and with the option to save recipes to Como Como database (favorites table). It is using external API (Spoonacular), React, Node/Express, MySQL, and Boostrap with CSS.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

- Run `yarn` in project directory, then, in terminal cd into client and run `yarn` in the client folder.

### For API calls

- You need to create an account on [Spoonacular API page] (<https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard>).

- In your profile on Spoonacular page you will find your API key which you can use to make a limited number of daily requests (150 points per day).

- Copy your API key and paste it to the .env file in your client instead of "YOUR_PASSWORD"; You will be using the API to get the recipes based on the ingredients passed in the form, and get get more information about selected recipes.

- See API routes design for Como Como app here: (<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6hC1gqfZJneQHDp_2504lU6ZBQmRVHWgkgRhHyvrLw/edit?usp=sharing>)

### Database Prep

- Create a database called `comocomo` through your SQL cli.

- Create a .env file in the project directory and add the info below; Make sure to change the DB_USER and DB_PASS to the username and password to your SQL cli :

      ```
      DB_HOST=localhost 
      DB_NAME=comocomo
      DB_USER=USER_NAME
      DB_PASS=YOUR_PASSWORD
      ```

Run `yarn migrate` in your terminal in the project folder in order to create `favorites` table in the `comocomo` database; Use this command whenever making changes to the database/table data within the init_db.sql file in model folder;

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `yarn start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- `cd client` and run `yarn start` to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
